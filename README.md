# Java-Console-Project
Java Console Project – Basics & Data Structures

This repository contains an interactive, menu-driven Java console application covering basic programs, algorithms, and advanced data structures. It’s designed for practice, learning, and revision of core Java, DSA, and algorithmic concepts.

Features
1. Basic Programs

Array operations: Read, print, return, multiply, sum, max/min, filter elements.

Value operations: Print numbers, sum of two, swap values (5 methods), find max of two, factorial, natural numbers.

Recursion programs: Factorial, sum of N numbers, print numbers and alphabets.

Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort (ascending & descending).

Searching algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search.

2. Advanced Data Structures

Singly Linked List (SLL)

Doubly Linked List (DLL)

Circular Linked List (CLL)

Stack and Queue

Binary Search Tree (BST)

(Accessed via DataStructures.programs() method.)

Project Structure

BasicProject.java – Main driver file with interactive menu and program logic.

UserSwitch.java (inner class) – Helper methods for value and array operations.

Sorting Classes: BubbleSort, QuickSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort.

Search.java – Linear and Binary search implementations.

BSTTree.java – Binary Search Tree operations (insert, delete, search, traversals).

Other Data Structure classes – For SLL, DLL, CLL, Stack, Queue (not shown here but referenced).
